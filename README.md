# odin-recipes
In this project i`m going to build a basic recipe website.
Also i`m going to apply my basice knowledge of the HTML.
At the end i expect to improve my knowladge,and have a better understanding 
of how HTML works.

Throughout the entire project, I found it endlessly interesting and 
exiting to do this. With practice, I learned how to add links,an unordered
list,and ordered list. I am delighted with my first project.
