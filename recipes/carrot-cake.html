  <h2>Key Carrot Cake Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
  <p>
    <li>
    <strong>I like using all-purpose flour,</strong>but you can subsitute some all-purpose
    flour for whole wheat or white whole wheat flour. Swap the flour for your favourite
    gluten-free flour blend for a gluten-free carrot cake.
    </li>
  </p>
  <p>
    <li>
    <strong>Baking soda</strong> helps the cake to rise. I don`t add backing powder-this 
    cake recipe does not need it.
    </li>
</p>
<p>
    <li>
    <strong>Salt,cinnamon,and vanilla extract</strong> make our cake taste amazing.
    </li>
</p>
<p>
    <li>
    <strong>Oil</strong> keeps the cake nice and moist-any neutral-flavored oil will work.
    Melted coconut oil works,too,but,the baked cake will have a light coconut flavor.We 
    use oil instead of butter when making 
    <a href="https://www.inspiredtaste.net/18982/our-favorite-easy-blueberry-muffin-recipe/">blueberry muffins</a>,too.
    </li>
</p>
<p>
    <li>
    <strong>Sugar</strong> makes the cake moist,light,and delicious. O love a conmbination of white and
    brown sugar,but you can use one or the other.
    </li>
</p>
<P>
    <li>
        <strong>Eggs</strong> give the cake structure.
    </li>
</P>
<p>
    <li>
        <strong>Lots of carrot</strong> make this the best carrot cake. I like to hang-grate my carrots 
    since i prefer the texture,but you can use your  food processor or buy pre-grated carrots from the store.
</li>
</p>
<p>
    <li>
        <strong>Pecans and raisins are optional!</strong> Some people love nuts and raisins in carrot cake,
    while other cannot stand to add them. These are entirely optional,so go with what you love.
    </li>
</p>
</ul>
