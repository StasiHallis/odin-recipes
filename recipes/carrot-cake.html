    <strong>This carrot cake is quick,easy to make,and utterly delicious.</strong> It wasn`t 
        until recently that i realized how much i love carrot cake.
        This was not something I ate as a child. Thanks to this easy recipe, i fell 
        in love.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not only is this the best-tasting carrot cake i`ve made,but it`s so easy to make.
    <strong> I bet you have most of what you need to make it in your kitchen right now.</strong>
  </p>
  <h2>Key Carrot Cake Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
  <p>
    <li>
    <strong>I like using all-purpose flour,</strong>but you can subsitute some all-purpose
    flour for whole wheat or white whole wheat flour. Swap the flour for your favourite
    gluten-free flour blend for a gluten-free carrot cake.
    </li>
  </p>
  <p>
    <li>
    <strong>Baking soda</strong> helps the cake to rise. I don`t add backing powder-this 
    cake recipe does not need it.
    </li>
</p>
<p>
    <li>
    <strong>Salt,cinnamon,and vanilla extract</strong> make our cake taste amazing.
    </li>
</p>
<p>
    <li>
    <strong>Oil</strong> keeps the cake nice and moist-any neutral-flavored oil will work.
    Melted coconut oil works,too,but,the baked cake will have a light coconut flavor.We 
    use oil instead of butter when making 
    <a href="https://www.inspiredtaste.net/18982/our-favorite-easy-blueberry-muffin-recipe/">blueberry muffins</a>,too.
    </li>
</p>
<p>
    <li>
    <strong>Sugar</strong> makes the cake moist,light,and delicious. O love a conmbination of white and
    brown sugar,but you can use one or the other.
    </li>
</p>
<P>
    <li>
        <strong>Eggs</strong> give the cake structure.
    </li>
</P>
<p>
    <li>
        <strong>Lots of carrot</strong> make this the best carrot cake. I like to hang-grate my carrots 
    since i prefer the texture,but you can use your  food processor or buy pre-grated carrots from the store.
</li>
</p>
<p>
    <li>
        <strong>Pecans and raisins are optional!</strong> Some people love nuts and raisins in carrot cake,
    while other cannot stand to add them. These are entirely optional,so go with what you love.
    </li>
</p>
</ul>
<h2>How to Make Carrot Cake from Scratch, You`ve Got This!</h2>
<p>
    <Strong> The method for this carrot cake recipe could not be simpler!</Strong> If you have a couple 
    of bowls and can stir ingredients togeher,you can make this cake!.
</p>
<ol>
<p>
    <li>
        <strong>Dry ingredients in one bowl,wet  ingredients in anouther:</strong> I like to 
        whisk my dry ingredients together in one bowl until they are well blended.
        Than, I whisk all the wet ingredients togeher in anouther bowl.
    </li>
</p>
<p>
<li>
    <strong>Fold the dry and wet ingredients together:</strong> Then i switch to a rubber spatula or 
    or large spoon and fold the two - wet and dry ingredients - together until I don`t see any large streaks
    of flour. 
</li>
</p>
<p>
    <li>
        <strong>Add carrot, nuts, and raisins:</strong> When I`ve got the batter ready, I fold in
        the carrots, and if I`m using them, the nuts and raisins.
    </li>

<h2>Tips for Baking Carrot Cake</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        I use two 8-inch or 9-inch light metal baking pans for this recipe. If you use the smaller 8-inch
        round pans, ensure the pan is at least 2 inches deep.
    </li>
    <p>
        <li>
            Butter and flor your pans or grease lightly and line with parchment paper.
        </li>
    </p>
    <p>
        <li>
            You cann tell carrot cake is ready to come out of the oven when it`s <strong>risen and 
                a bit bouncy when you lightly touch it</strong> - I use one or two fingers and lightly 
                push. If you leave a dent in the cake, it needs a bit more time.
        </li>
    </p>
    <p>
        <li>
            Cool the cake layers completely bafore frosting. I like to cool them in the pans for 15 minutes
            and then turn them onto a cooling rack to cool completely.
        </li>
    </p>
</ol>
